CRITICAL BUG FOUND:
Browser console error: "Invalid currency: usd. Your account currently supports these currencies: idr."

The Stripe account ONLY supports IDR. The resolveCheckoutCurrency function returns "usd" for non-Indonesian users.
This is the root cause of the "Unexpected token '<'" JSON error - Stripe rejects the request, 
and the error response is HTML (not JSON), causing the parse error.

FIX: Force all checkout sessions to use IDR currency since the Stripe account only supports IDR.
Convert USD prices to IDR at checkout time.
